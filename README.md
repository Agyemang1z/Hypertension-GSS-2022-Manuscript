Background: Hypertension remains a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting nearly half of the adult population. Despite considerable public health efforts, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension remains high, particularly among individuals with coexisting chronic conditions and adverse lifestyle factors.

Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 2,335 adults who participated in the 2022 General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized U.S. residents aged ≥18 years. Hypertension status was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis. Predictor variables included sociodemographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors. Single-level binary logistic regression with best subset selection, along with Random Forest and Decision Tree classification models, were used to identify the most significant determinants of hypertension.

Results: The prevalence of self-reported hypertension in the analytic sample was 29.1% (n = 685). In the best subset logistic regression model, three variables were independently and significantly associated with hypertension: age, diabetes status, and sleep disturbance frequency (pseudo R² = 0.112; AIC = 2518.855; p < 0.001). Compared with adults aged 18–30 years, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 2.38 (95% CI: 1.70–3.34) for ages 31–40, rising to 6.99 (95% CI: 4.96–9.86) for those aged >60 years. Diabetes was associated with a nearly fourfold increase in odds of hypertension (AOR = 3.85; 95% CI: 2.95–5.04). Compared to respondents who “often” had trouble sleeping, the odds of hypertension were 32% lower for those who “rarely” had trouble sleeping (AOR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.88) and 54% lower for those who “never” had trouble sleeping (AOR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.32–0.66). Machine learning models corroborated these results: in the Random Forest model, diabetes (importance = 0.141), age (0.129), and sleep disturbance (0.092) were top-ranked predictors; the Decision Tree model identified sleep disturbance (0.810), diabetes (0.044), and age (0.028) as most influential.

Conclusions: Across traditional and machine learning approaches, advancing age, diabetes, and poor sleep quality emerged as the most reliable predictors of hypertension in U.S. adults. Targeted prevention strategies focused on older populations, integrated management of diabetes and hypertension, and interventions to improve sleep quality could substantially reduce hypertension prevalence and its associated disease burden. Longitudinal research is warranted to clarify causal pathways and inform evidence-based policy and practice.
